The resources provided on the earth are limited. If we continue to deplete the
resources at this pace, then they will soon exhaust. Urbanisation and development
have resulted in excessive use of resources. For example, we are cutting trees to
make houses, roads, and railway tracks. We are mining minerals and fossil fuels for
transportation activities. We are extensively using water for agriculture and other
activities. Our comfort has led to the destruction of nature. Deforestation, global warming,
wildlife destruction, environmental pollution, ecosystem imbalance etc., are the consequences
that threaten biodiversity and life on earth. To overcome them, we need to conserve nature.

Conserving nature means protecting, preserving and restoring biodiversity. We can do so by
taking care of small things such as making use of: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle.
It will help in reducing waste management. We should plant trees in our surroundings and increase
the greenery around us. Conserving water and saving it is also a way of conserving nature. We can
also conserve rainwater by adopting the rainwater harvesting method. We must use and promote alternative
energy sources such as solar energy and wind energy and thus adopt sustainable development concepts. We can
conserve nature by taking care of small activities at home. These activities include switching off the lights,
fans, and AC when not in use, switching to public transport and carpooling, composting waste at home, using
recyclable bags and containers, and educating our children about climate change and nature conservation.
