Being one of the most fundamental natural resources that all living things need,
water should be considered a top priority, but human beings do not really understand
its significance in their lives. The Earth and the human body are so similar because of
the fact that most of it is coverednby water, without which survival of any kind would be impossible.

The purposes of water are manifold. Water on Earth is required to cultivate vegetation and
all plant life. It is a natural habitat for all aquatic animals and sea creatures. Water serves
its purpose as drinking water for animals and human beings. It is also used by human beings for
cooking, cleaning and other household chores.

All living beings can be deprived of food, shelter or comfort, but they cannot survive without
water. Water is required to maintain personal and domestic hygiene that would be enough to promote
good health. With the increase in population, industrialisation and high living standards, the demand
for water is on the increase. With this being the scenario, gaining access to clean drinking water and
sanitation would turn out to be highly challenging and extremely difficult.

Through the years, we have seen the rise in water pollution due to the disposal of toxic chemicals and
industrial waste into the water bodies, untreated sewage, fertilisers, pesticides, animal wastes, etc.
There will definitely be more and more problems because of shortages in water supply and availability of
clean drinking water if this continues.
